      <h1>How do you Stop Cyberbullying?</h1>

        <ol>
          <li class="b"> <b>Tell Someone</b><br/>
            <p>
              If you believe that your child is being bullied, or is a bully, it’s critical for you to reach out immediately.
              Look for practical ways to address the issue, such as involving school administrators and/or a therapist or by contacting social media sites directly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Keep Everything</b><br/>
            <p>
              There is no time to hesitate if you believe that your child is the victim of cyberbullying. Reach out to your child immediately. Save all posts,
              messages and communications from the bully by taking screenshots, or photos on your smartphone, in addition to recording the time and date and any
              other relevant information. Bring everything to the school administration and consider involving the police if you feel that things have crossed the line.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Dont Engage</b><br/>
            <p>
              The best option for victims is to block the bully from social media and email accounts altogether. For many social media apps, such as Facebook or Instagram,
              blocking not only removes the bully from the victim’s view, it also means that the bully can no longer directly link to the victim’s profile or even see posts
              by mutual contacts that tag the victim.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Learn More</b><br/>
            <p>
              One common misconception is that boys are always the aggressors with and girls, the likely victims. However, girls are just as likely as boys to be both victims and bullies.
              While boys are more likely to threaten physical violence, girls focus on emotional abuse designed to undermine victims’ self-esteem, which can be even more damaging.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Understand the Scope</b><br/>
            <p>
              Many adults believe social media sites are the likely stages for the bullying behaviors, and they’re right. But, with 95% of teens now using smartphones,
              there’s a far greater scope of potential harm. Bullying can occur on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, or through Snapchat, emails and texts coming directly from bullies.
              In addition to almost ubiquitous smartphone access, 45% of teens report near constant online activity, harassment too can become almost constant. With the rapid changes
              in technology, it’s imperative to continuously monitor your children’s mobile devices and their online behavior to stay ahead of any potential threats.
            </p>

          <li class="b"> <b>Recognise the Signs</b><br/>
            <p>
              A cyberbullied child looks the same as any adolescent—often unwilling to talk about his or her day or disclose personal information.
              But you should be on the lookout for other signs that your child is the victim of cyberbullying, like a loss of interest in favorite activities,
              an unexplained decline in grades, skipped classes, symptoms of depression and changes in sleeping or eating habits. While any of these may be indicative of multiple concerns,
              be especially alert if also notice a sudden lack of interest in using the computer or a tendency to become upset after being online or using their smartphone.
              Or in the case of a child who is the aggressor, extreme anger if you take his or her phone or computer privileges away.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Keep Data Secure</b><br/>
            <p>
              Make sure you understand how to create secure passwords and to change them regularly. Bullies have been known to hack or “hijack” victims’ profiles to post rude and
              offensive comments. Likewise, teens should always set their social media profiles to “private” and ignore messages from people they don’t know altogether.
              Today’s comprehensive internet security solutions include password management tools and other cybersecurity features that can help keep your children’s account and
              online identities secure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Don't Get Turned Around</b><br/>
            <p>
              Make sure to educate your teen about being respectful of others’ feelings and privacy online. Tell your child that you understand the impulse to retaliate,
              but that in the long-term it’s best to not get involved in that way.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Stand Together</b><br/>
            <p>
              It’s important to stand together and look for long-term solutions to cyberbullying. In 2015 Canada passed a bill into law that made it illegal to distribute images
              of a person without their consent, and allows police to obtain a warrant for information about internet users based on “reasonable grounds to suspect” an offense
              has been perpetrated. The bill wasn’t perfect, but it became a road map for future legislation to keep kids safe on the internet. Meanwhile, in the US, laws vary by state,
              so it’s important to understand your rights and escalate things to the proper authorities if they become out of hand.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="b"> <b>Hold Bullies Accountable</b><br/>
            <p>
              Cyberbullying statistics make it clear: This is a persistent, serious problem. Armed with data, open communication and actionable solutions, however,
              parents and teens can help turn the tide against cyberbullying.
